# Graceful Paths â€” Teaching Portfolio

This is a Vite + React + TypeScript project (shadcn-ui + Tailwind) for a teaching portfolio.

Quick start (local):

```powershell
# install dependencies
npm install

# start dev server
npm run dev
```

The app will then be available at http://localhost:8080/ by default.

If you'd like, I can help remove any other third-party traces or tidy up remaining files.
